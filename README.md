# ArtnetSender
A program to send artnet from a computer recieving artnet, to a server. 
The server recieving data has to turn of the firewall, hehe. Still working on this problem.  

Using the stupidArtnet library. 
Install with pip install stupidartnet. 

I used QLC (Quick Light Controller pluss) as a lightcontroller on my computer.

This is still in work. The program is meant to be used as a sender in a raspberry pi which is connected to a grandMA 2/3, to send Artnet to a server.
The server hosts a website that changes color based on the rgb values that grandMA 2/3 sends.
